# [Coronavirus Blocker](https://github.com/realmichaelye/CoronaBlocker) - Adblock, but for COVID19
**Motivation:** The endless coronavirus news doesn't help, it only enhances the fear & anxiety in us. Most of us know enough about it e.g. best practices, and the future of COVID-19 is NOT in our control (unless you're directly solving it). 
The goal of this extension is to redirect your energy on things that are in your control, such as learning a new instrument, learning to code, etc... instead of being distracted by events that you can't change. Coronavirus is bad enough for our physical health, let it not degrade our mental health too.
*Stop focusing on what you can't change, instead install this chrome extension and enjoy corona-free browsing.*
